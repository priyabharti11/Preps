<h5>Key Difference and Definition of Library and Framework <br>
- The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".<br>
- When you call a method from a library, you are in control. <br>
- But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.
</h5>
<h4> Framework</h4>
 
<h5><p> - In a framework, all the control flow is already there and there are many predefined white spots that we should fill out with our code.
        - A framework is normally more complex. It defines a skeleton where the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton.
        - In this way, our code will be called by the framework appropriately.</p> </h5>
